~-config.jar is used at runtime to supply this core project with properties
typically supplied by the application using the core project ... ~-config.jar
is used to test (run main, junit etc) on the core project in stand-alone mode and is
not deployed with the core project but is deployed with the application using the core project.
The application should have it's own properties dir containing the core properties files and related,
and should deploy it's own ~app~-config.jar properties jar file.
